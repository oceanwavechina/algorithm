Priority Queues: Heaps
------------------

**Definition**:
> Binary max-heap is a binary-tree where the value of each node is at least the values of its children. （也就是父节点 大于等于 子节点）

> In the previous module, we defined the height of a tree as the number of nodes on a longest path from the root to a leaf. In this module, we use a slightly different definition of the height: we define it to be equal to the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
